üìñ NeuroShield User Manual
(Version 3.0)

üõ°Ô∏è Introduction
NeuroShield is a real-time screen monitoring tool designed to detect potentially hazardous visual flicker that may cause brainwave entrainment, eye strain, or neurological stress.
It is especially useful for gamers, digital creatives, neurodivergent users, and those sensitive to visual stimuli.

‚úÖ Key Features:

Real-time analysis of screen flicker
Detection of critical brainwave frequency bands (Theta, Alpha, Gamma)
Blue light exposure monitoring
Full session reports with danger level assessment
Lightweight and easy to use

------------------------------------------------------------

üñ•Ô∏è System Requirements

Requirement:		Minimum:
--------------------------------------------------------------
Operating System:	Windows 10 / 11 (64-bit)
RAM:			4GB or higher recommended

3. Choose Scan Duration
Options:

2 minutes

5 minutes

10 minutes

Unlimited (manual stop)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Start the Scan
Click "Start Scan".

NeuroShield will silently monitor your screen for flicker and blue light anomalies.

Status will update to "Scanning..."
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Stop the Scan
Click "Stop Scan" at any time.

When finished, a full report will be generated automatically.

6. View the About Window
Click "About" to see the app version, motto, and credits.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

üß™ How Detection Works
Frame Capture: NeuroShield samples your screen up to 300 times per second.

Brightness/Color Extraction: Each frame is analyzed for overall brightness and color ratios (Red, Green, Blue).

FFT Frequency Analysis: Rapid changes in brightness are converted into a frequency spectrum.

Brainwave Band Detection: Specific dangerous frequency ranges are monitored:

Theta (4‚Äì8 Hz)

Alpha (8‚Äì12 Hz)

Gamma (30‚Äì50 Hz)

Danger Alerts: If abnormal flicker is detected, it is logged with time and frame number.

Session Report: Summarizes overall exposure and any risks.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

üßæ Understanding the Session Report
At the end of each session, NeuroShield saves a .txt report including:

Session Duration

Monitor Scanned

Frames Analyzed

Average Red, Green, Blue light exposure

Detected Flicker Warnings

Overall Danger Level

Brainwave Risk Chart

‚úÖ Reports are timestamped for easy record-keeping.

üéØ How to test NeuroShield with YouTube

Test Type:					How to Set It Up:
Flicker Detection Test		Play a YouTube video that has fast flashing lights, strobe effects, glitch videos, horror jump scares.
Blue Light Exposure Test	Play a video with very intense blue backgrounds, like ocean scenes, cyberpunk cityscapes, sci-fi video.
Combined Test			Play a music video or anime scene with lots of rapid color changes ‚Äî including strong blues and flashing lights.

EXAMPLE-> Blue Light Exposure Test: Hyper Speed Flashing Color Changing - Black Blue Screen [10 Minutes SEIZURE WARNING]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

Problem:						Solution:
App doesn't start:			Make sure you extracted the ZIP folder fully before running.
Missing shield image in About window:	Ensure the neuroshield_icon.png file is bundled or included properly in build.
High CPU/GPU usage:			Reduce frame sampling rate (future versions will allow tuning).
False positives in flicker detection:	Flicker warnings are based on frequency intensity; some fast scene changes may naturally 														    trigger them.

‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

Q: Does NeuroShield require an internet connection?
A: ‚ùå No, it runs entirely offline for the basic version.

Q: Does NeuroShield monitor my camera or microphone?
A: ‚ùå Absolutely not. NeuroShield only analyzes screen display data and flicker rate.

Q: Can NeuroShield prevent seizures or migraines?
A: ‚ö† NeuroShield is a detection and preventative tool, not a medical device. It provides detection, not treatment. 

Q: How accurate is the brainwave band detection?
A: ‚úÖ It uses real-time FFT frequency analysis, matching clinically recognized EEG frequency ranges.

Q: Will there be updates?
A: ‚úÖ Future updates are planned, including "NeuroShield Pro" with customizable settings and passive background monitoring.
